The percentage of identical amino acid and the alignment score(BLOSUM score) for each comparison:
human-mouse:
percentage of identical amino acid:96.54%
alignment score:1490

human-random:
percentage of identical amino acid:2.77%
alignment score:-351

mouse-random:
percentage of identical amino acid:3.11%
alignment score:-348

My biological and evolutionary interpretation made from these dataï¼š
Larger percentage and alignment score indicate greater similarity between two DNA sequences.
From the results above, I find that the percentage of identical amino acids and alignment score are much higher in the human-mouse comparison.
It indicates that DLX5 gene may play an important role in human and mouse.
Additionally, human and mouse may have the same ancestor and DLX5 gene may be highly conserved in evolution.
