human-mouse:
percentage of identical amino acid:0.97
BLOSUM score:1490

human-random:
percentage of identical amino acid:0.03
BLOSUM score:-351

mouse-random:
percentage of identical amino acid:0.03
BLOSUM score:-348

From the results above, I find that the percentage of identical amino acids is much higher in the human-mouse comparison, which indicates that human and mouse have the same ancestor and DLX5 gene is highly conserved in evolution.
